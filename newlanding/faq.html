Your knowledge of cricket and smart thinking are all the tools you need to create a winning virtual squad. You need to draft a team comprising of the virtual counterparts of real-world players and compete against other virtual teams drafted by other participating users. Each virtual counterpart of a real-world player is attributed points based on the statistical elements of the real-world player’s performance in the match(es) in respect of which the fantasy game is offered, whose elements include runs scored, wickets taken, stumpings made, catches taken, sixes scored, strike rate at which runs are scored and runs conceded. The winning user is the one whose virtual team collects the most number of points relative to the other participating users in the fantasy contest.</p>

We don’t allow users to create multiple accounts as it violates our Fairplay policy. However, if you’re thinking you need to have multiple accounts to have multiple squad, you’re in for a surprise. On Dotball, you can own up to 6 squads for a match with one single account.</p>

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>You did not upload the PAN Card which is mandatory as proof of identity.</li>
                                                    <li>You did not upload a clear picture of your PAN card.</li>
                                                    <li>PAN on your card doesn’t match the PAN you entered.</li>
                                                    <li>Your date of birth on PAN card does not match the one mentioned on your Dotball account.</li>
                                                    <li>Your name on the PAN card does not match the name on the bank account.</li>
                                                    <li>IFSC code you provided in the bank details is incorrect. If you provide the IFSC code for a different bank, there is a good chance that your winnings may be transferred to someone else’s account.</li>
                                                </ul>
